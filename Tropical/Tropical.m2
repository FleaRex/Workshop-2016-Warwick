    Headline
	the intersection of the tropical hypersurfaces of polynomials in L
    Usage
	tropicalPrevariety(L)
    Inputs
	L:List
	    of polynomials
    Outputs
	F:List
	    the intersection of the tropical hypersurfaces of polynomials in L
    Description
	Text
	    This method intersects a list of tropical hypersurfaces. The input is a list of polynomials whose 		    tropicalizations give the hypersurfaces.
        Example
	    QQ[x,y]
	    tropicalPrevariety{x+y+1, x+y}
