We need to get Lars to implement the change we made in ???add file name 


---------------
- gfanInterface2
---------------

There are three errors left.  Two of them have comments attached, and
the work that is needed is to understand how to handle gfan output
that is a PolyhedralCone.  The other I (DM) don't understand yet.

There's also a lot of commented out stuff that we should probably delete
(after checking tests) and also some other things that we should comment
out (e.g, checking for keys in hash tables that no longer exist).
